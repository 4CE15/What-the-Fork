# Profiles
We're going to learn two things at once: forking and markdown.

This README is written in markdown. You will write your profile in markdown as well. I know what you're thinking: ["What is markdown?!?!!"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+markdown%3F) You'll figure it out.

Create a profile with the following info and formatting using markdown:

First and Lastname (Heading2 size)

Horizontal Rule

Hometown: Anytown (bold)

Age: YourAge (italics)

Top 3 Favorite foods (numbered list)

3 Movies/TV Shows that you've watched in the last year. (bulleted list)

Fictional character that I would like to punch in the face. (strikethrough)

Add your profile below this line:
